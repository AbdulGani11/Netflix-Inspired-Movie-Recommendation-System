 * API Service for Interaction Tracking
 * 
 * This module provides methods for tracking user interactions with content,
 * which are used by the recommendation engine to improve suggestions.
 * 
 * In a production environment, this would send data to Firebase Firestore
 * or another backend service. For this portfolio demo, interactions are 
 * logged to the console and handled by the in-memory recommendation system.

 * @param {string} type - Type of interaction (view, click, complete, etc.)
 * @param {Object} details - Additional interaction details
